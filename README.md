# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts students’ math performance using machine learning techniques.
It analyzes how academic and non-academic factors influence student outcomes.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The goal is to identify important factors affecting student performance and
build a predictive model to estimate math scores.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains student information such as:
- Gender
- Parental level of education
